## Manual Test Results

| # | Action | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|---|--------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Create triangle with vertices (50,50), (20,70), (70,70) | Triangle created with correct coordinates, area ≈ 500, perimeter ≈ 114.34 | | |
| 2 | Create rectangle at (100,20) with width 10, length 15 | Rectangle created with correct coordinates, area = 150, perimeter = 50 | | |
| 3 | Create circle at (80,100) with radius 25 | Circle created with correct coordinates, area ≈ 1963.5, perimeter ≈ 157.1 | | |
| 4 | Create square at (90,40) with side 20 | Square created with correct coordinates, area = 400, perimeter = 80 | | |
| 5 | Add three more shapes | 7 shapes in list | | |
| 6 | View area and perimeter of shape at position 1 | Area = 150, perimeter = 50 | | |
| 7 | Display all shapes | All 7 shapes shown with correct properties | | |
| 8 | Remove shape at position 2 | Shape removed, 6 shapes remain | | |
| 9 | Translate all shapes (10,15) | All shapes moved by (10,15) | | |
| 10 | Display all shapes after translation | All coordinates updated correctly | | |
| 11 | Scale all shapes by factor 2 | All dimensions doubled | | |
| 12 | Display shapes after scaling | Positions unchanged, dimensions doubled | | |
| 13 | Try creating shape with invalid dimensions | Appropriate error handling | | |
| 14 | Try removing shape at position 20 | Error message for invalid position | | |
| 15 | Try accessing shape at position 100 | Error message for invalid position | | |
