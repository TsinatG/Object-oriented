# Generating UML Diagrams from PlantUML File

This guide explains how to generate a visual UML diagram from the provided `ShapeManagementUML.puml` file.

## Option 1: Online PlantUML Server

The easiest way to generate the diagram is to use the online PlantUML server:

1. Go to [PlantUML Online Server](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/)
2. Open the `ShapeManagementUML.puml` file in a text editor
3. Copy the entire content of the file
4. Paste it into the text area on the PlantUML website
5. The diagram will be generated automatically
6. You can download the diagram as PNG, SVG, or other formats

## Option 2: VS Code Extension

If you're using Visual Studio Code:

1. Install the "PlantUML" extension by jebbs
   - Open VS Code
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "PlantUML"
   - Install the extension by jebbs

2. Open the `ShapeManagementUML.puml` file in VS Code

3. To preview the diagram:
   - Right-click in the editor
   - Select "PlantUML: Preview Current Diagram"
   - Or use Alt+D to preview

4. To export the diagram:
   - Right-click in the editor
   - Select "PlantUML: Export Current Diagram"
   - Choose your preferred format (PNG, SVG, etc.)

## Option 3: Local Installation

For advanced users who prefer local rendering:

1. Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
   - Download from [java.com](https://www.java.com)

2. Download PlantUML jar file
   - Go to [PlantUML Downloads](https://plantuml.com/download)
   - Download `plantuml.jar`

3. Install Graphviz (required by PlantUML)
   - Windows: Download from [Graphviz Downloads](https://graphviz.org/download/)
   - Linux: Use package manager (e.g., `apt-get install graphviz`)
   - macOS: Use Homebrew (`brew install graphviz`)

4. Generate the diagram
   - Open a terminal/command prompt
   - Navigate to the directory containing both the `.puml` file and `plantuml.jar`
   - Run: `java -jar plantuml.jar ShapeManagementUML.puml`
   - This will create a PNG file in the same directory

## Understanding the UML Diagram

The generated UML diagram shows the class hierarchy and relationships in the Shape Management System:

- Abstract base class: `Shape`
- Utility class: `Coordinates`
- Derived shape classes: `Point`, `Line`, `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`, and `Square`
- Management class: `ShapeList`

The diagram uses standard UML notation:
- Inheritance: Represented by a line with a hollow triangle pointing to the parent class
- Composition: Represented by a line with a filled diamond
- Association: Represented by a simple line

The visibility of class members is indicated by:
- `+` for public members
- `#` for protected members
- `-` for private members
